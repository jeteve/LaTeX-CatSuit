This directory contains unit test scripts for the LaTeX::Driver module.

The test scripts invoke the module to format documents in
subdirectories of the testdata directory.  Each subdirectory
corresponds to a single test script. The subdirectory should be
cleaned out at the start of the test script and again at the end of
the script.

The test documents are structured so that they each test an aspect of
LaTeX formatting and the test scripts look for a series of patterns in
the generated dvi files.
